## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and run the GasGuard system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1.  **Hardware Components:**
    * An ESP32 development board.
    * MQ-2, MQ-4, and MQ-9 gas sensors.
    * A compatible GSM Module (e.g., SIM900A or SIM800L) with an activated SIM card (ensure it supports 2G if using older modules).
    * Standard LEDs (e.g., red for alert, green for normal).
    * A 5V active buzzer.
    * Breadboard, connecting wires (jumper wires), and appropriate resistors (refer to sensor datasheets and the system architecture in the research paper, Fig. 1).
    * A stable power supply for the ESP32 and GSM module (typically 5V for ESP32, check GSM module voltage requirements).
2.  **Software & Accounts:**
    * **Arduino IDE** (latest version recommended) or **PlatformIO** (for more advanced users).
    * **ESP32 Board Support Package:** Install via Arduino IDE's Board Manager or PlatformIO's configuration.
    * **Python 3.x** installed on your computer for model training.
    * **Required Python Libraries:** Install using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
        # Install any other libraries explicitly imported in Train_svm.py
        ```
    * A **ThingSpeak Account:**
        * Sign up at [ThingSpeak.com](https://thingspeak.com/).
        * Create a new channel with fields corresponding to the data you want to log (e.g., MQ-2 reading, MQ-4 reading, MQ-9 reading, SVM status). Note down the **Channel ID** and **Write API Key**.
    * **Arduino Libraries:**
        * Check the `#include` statements in `GasGuard_SVM.ino`. You will likely need libraries for:
            * ESP32 Wi-Fi communication.
            * GSM module communication (e.g., `SoftwareSerial` might be used, or a specific library for your GSM module).
            * Any specific libraries for the MQ sensors if they require more than analog reads.
        * Install these libraries via the Arduino IDE's Library Manager.

### Hardware Assembly

Carefully assemble the hardware components based on the system architecture diagram provided in the research paper (Figure 1). Key connections include:
* **MQ Sensors:** Connect the analog output pins of the MQ sensors to available analog input pins on the ESP32. Ensure correct VCC and GND connections.
* **LEDs & Buzzer:** Connect LEDs (with current-limiting resistors) and the buzzer to digital output pins of the ESP32.
* **GSM Module:**
    * Connect the TXD pin of the GSM module to an RXD-capable pin on the ESP32 (often using `SoftwareSerial` or a hardware serial port).
    * Connect the RXD pin of the GSM module to a TXD-capable pin on the ESP32.
    * Provide appropriate power and ground to the GSM module. **Note:** GSM modules can be power-hungry, especially during network registration and transmission; ensure your power supply can handle the current spikes.
* **Power:** Ensure all components are powered correctly and share a common ground.

### 1. SVM Model Training (`Train_svm.py`)

The SVM model is critical for enhancing the system's accuracy and minimizing false alarms.

1.  **Data Collection & Preparation:**
    * Collect comprehensive sensor data from your MQ-2, MQ-4, and MQ-9 sensors under diverse, known conditions:
        * Normal ambient air.
        * Presence of target gases (methane, propane, carbon monoxide) at various concentrations (low, medium, high).
        * Simulate conditions that might cause false positives with traditional threshold-based systems.
    * Structure this data into a suitable format for training (e.g., CSV). Each data point should include sensor readings as features and a label indicating the condition (e.g., 0 for normal, 1 for methane leak, 2 for CO leak, etc.).
    * The `feed.json` file in the repository might serve as an example of data structure or could be a placeholder for your collected training data.
2.  **Model Training Execution:**
    * Modify `Train_svm.py` to:
        * Load your prepared dataset.
        * Preprocess the data as needed (e.g., scaling, normalization).
        * Configure SVM parameters (kernel type, C, gamma ‚Äì experimentation might be needed).
    * Run the training script from your terminal:
        ```bash
        python Train_svm.py
        ```
3.  **Model Output & Integration:**
    * The `Train_svm.py` script should output the parameters of the trained SVM model. This typically includes:
        * Support Vectors.
        * Coefficients (alphas or dual coefficients).
        * Intercept (rho or b).
        * Kernel parameters if applicable.
    * These parameters need to be **manually transferred or programmatically converted** into a format suitable for embedding within the `GasGuard_SVM.ino` Arduino sketch. This often involves creating C/C++ arrays or structures to store these values for the SVM prediction function on the ESP32. The research paper mentions the model size is around 135 KB, implying a relatively compact model suitable for microcontrollers.

### 2. ESP32 Setup & Programming (`GasGuard_SVM.ino`)

1.  **Configure the Arduino Sketch:**
    * Open `GasGuard_SVM.ino` in your Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
    * **Pin Definitions:** Update the pin numbers for sensors (MQ-2, MQ-4, MQ-9), LEDs, buzzer, and GSM module (TX, RX pins) to match your actual hardware connections on the ESP32.
    * **Network Credentials:**
        * If using Wi-Fi for ThingSpeak: Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password.
    * **ThingSpeak Configuration:** Input your ThingSpeak **Channel ID** and **Write API Key**.
    * **GSM Configuration:** Enter the phone number(s) to which SMS alerts should be sent.
    * **SVM Model Integration:**
        * Carefully embed the SVM model parameters (support vectors, coefficients, intercept) obtained from the Python training script into the designated arrays or variables within the sketch.
        * Ensure the SVM prediction logic in the sketch correctly uses these parameters.
    * **Thresholds (Optional but Recommended):** While SVM enhances detection, you might still want basic thresholds for immediate critical alerts or as a fallback.
2.  **Compile and Upload:**
    * In the Arduino IDE/PlatformIO, select the correct ESP32 board type (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
    * Select the correct COM port to which your ESP32 is connected.
    * Compile the sketch to check for errors.
    * Upload the compiled sketch to your ESP32.
    * Open the Serial Monitor (set baud rate, typically 115200) to observe debug messages, sensor readings, and system status.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: System Workflow

The GasGuard system operates through a well-defined workflow:

1.  **Initialization:**
    * Upon power-up, the ESP32 initializes its peripherals, sensors, GSM module, and Wi-Fi connection (if used for ThingSpeak).
    * It attempts to connect to the GSM network.
2.  **Continuous Sensing:**
    * The ESP32 periodically reads analog values from the MQ-2, MQ-4, and MQ-9 gas sensors.
    * These raw readings might undergo initial processing like averaging or calibration.
3.  **Data Processing & SVM Inference:**
    * The collected sensor readings (features) are fed into the embedded SVM model.
    * The SVM model classifies the current atmospheric condition based on its training (e.g., "Normal," "Methane Detected," "CO Detected," "High Risk").
4.  **Alert Generation & Notification:**
    * **Decision Logic:** Based on the SVM output (and potentially basic thresholds as a backup):
        * If a hazardous condition is identified:
            * **Local Alarms:** The corresponding LED(s) are activated (e.g., red LED blinks), and the buzzer sounds.
            * **Remote SMS Alert:** The ESP32 commands the GSM module to send an SMS message containing details of the alert (e.g., type of gas, location if configured) to the pre-programmed emergency phone number(s).
        * If conditions are normal, the system remains in monitoring mode (e.g., a green LED might indicate normal status).
5.  **Cloud Data Logging (ThingSpeak):**
    * Periodically, or upon significant events, the ESP32 sends the latest sensor readings and SVM status to the configured ThingSpeak channel using its Write API Key.
    * This allows for:
        * Remote real-time monitoring of gas levels via the ThingSpeak dashboard.
        * Storage of historical data for trend analysis, pattern recognition, and post-incident investigation.
        * Creation of charts and visualizations.
6.  **Fault Detection (Mentioned in Paper):**
    * The machine learning model can also help identify sensor failures or anomalous readings that deviate significantly from normal patterns, contributing to system reliability.
